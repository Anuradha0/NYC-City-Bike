# NYC-City-Bike
To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis.
For this analysis, you’ll use Pandas to change the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype. Then, using the converted datatype, you’ll create a set of visualizations to:
Show the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders
Show the number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
Show the number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.

Deliverable 1: Change Trip Duration to a Datetime Format
Deliverable 2: Create Visualizations for the Trip Analysis
Deliverable 3: Create a Story and Report for the Final Presentation

**RESULTS:**

**Deliverable 1:**
Using Python and Pandas functions, you’ll convert the "tripduration" column from an integer to a datetime datatype to get the time in hours, minutes, and seconds (00:00:00). 
Your final results should look similar to the following image:

**Deliverable 2:**
1) Checkout Time for Users: In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders.

2) Create the Checkout Times by Gender Viz: In this visualization, you’ll graph the length of time that bikes are checked out for each gender.

3) Create the Trips by Weekday for Each Hour Viz: In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by weekday for each hour of the day as a heatmap.

4) Create the Trips by Gender (Weekday per Hour) Viz: In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour of each day of the week as a heatmap.

5) Create the User Trips by Gender by Weekday Viz: In this visualization, you’ll graph the number of bike trips by gender for each hour for each day of the week as a heatmap.

6) Males seems to be the largest Citibike users any day of the week.

**SUMMARY:**
I  observed that during weekdays bike usage is more around mid-morning and late afternoons, meaning our rides are using CitiBikes as a commuting alternative.
Two additional visualizations are suggested for future analysis

1) Analysis tells that more than 80% are Subscribers, with an ~19% or regular non-subscribers

2) Total of 65% General Male use, 25% General Female with an Unknown gender that relies on non-subscribers users. In addition, Peak by Gener spike on same time frame.
